# odin-recipes
Simple Html only site.

This is a web project using only the HTML language to prove the skills acquired in the "Odin Project" course.
"Odin Recipes" is a web page that displays 3 recipes each containing an image of the dish, the ingredients that are used and the prepparation method.

This is the first web development course that has teached me as much as it did. In my university projects I would lazily follow tutorials and copy them to the T without retaining much. Even if simple, I could make this project with all I have learned without looking anything up and without much struggle, I persoanlly think that's a big deal. The Odin Project in my opinion has been nothing but good and I look forward to the next projects I build.

Thank you for the people who wrote these recipes, here are websites from where I took inspiration from:
