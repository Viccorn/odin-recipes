    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>And the actual dish is so easy to make!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil and adding spaghetti. Cook pasta according to
            package instructions until al dente. Drain pasta, reserving about ½ cup of the water. You might need it to
            thin out the pasta sauce a bit. Set pasta and reserved water aside.</li>
        <li>While water is boiling and pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion
            and cook for about 5 minutes, until onion is starting to soften.</li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes into onion and cook for 2 minutes. I use 2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a really
            nice kick. If you love extra spicy food, you can use more. If you're worried about the dish being too spicy,
            use less. You can always sprinkle some more on top!</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
            tomatoes have softened and released their juices.</li>
        <li>Use a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon to crush the tomatoes slightly and release more of their
            juices.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There's your super easy and completely homemade pasta sauce!</p>
